CREPES
=======

The dough has to be prepared 20 minutes to 1 hour before the pan cooking.

In this recipe I use margarine. You can definitely use to butter or oil: switch margarine by either 5 spoons of oil or 20g of butter (but seriously your arteries will thank you for using margarine instead).

#### Ingredients (for 20-30 crepes):
* 500g flour
* a pinch of baking powder (optional)
* 3/4L milk
* 4 eggs
* 20g margarine
* 1 spoon of brown rum (optional but so tasty)
* 1 sachet of vanilla sugar
* the zest of half a lemon

Your margarine needs to be melted, use a waterbath or your microwaves oven to do so. Personally I put my margarine in a cup and the cup in a bowl full of just boiled water. Once it is melted add a bit of milk in the cup and mix it (the aim of this is to get your margarine melted but not to hot so your eggs won't get cooked when you'll add it in a next step)

In a jar, mix the dry ingredients: flour, baking powder, vanilla sugar and lemon zest. Form a well in the center of your mix.

Add the eggs (white + yellow), the milk and the melted margarine. 

Blend gently and make sure to get all the flour. Once you get an uniform dough, add the rum and mix again. 

Let your dough aside for 20 minutes to 1 hour. Once you're ready mix it again and if the dough is not liquid enough add some more milk.

Warm your pan a bit. Put some margarine on a kitchen paper towel and wipe the pan with it (beware to not burn yourself: the pan must be hot but not too much, if you hear some cracklings wait a minute or two). Once you're done you can start putting the dough in the pan: have fun ^____^

Crepes can be kept refrigerated for 3-4 days but it is pure speculation because I never managed to keep some for so long.
