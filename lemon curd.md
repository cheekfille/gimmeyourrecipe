LEMON CURD
===========

#### Ingredients (for 2 pots of lemon curd, medium size)
- 3-4 lemons
- 5 spoons of sugar (I use brown sugar but white should be fine too)
- 1 big spoon of cornstarch
- 3-4 eggs

Clean and dry 2 pots.

Press the lemons. 

Put the cornstarch in a small bowl and pour some lemon juice in it. Progressively blend with a small spoon until you obtain a uniform dough.

Put the rest of the juice and the sugar in a pan and heat up until the sugar is melted. Add the cornstarch dough and start mixing until you get something uniform. Put the pan off the fire.

In a bowl mix the eggs together with a fork and add this blend to the pan content. Be ready to mix vigorously when you add the eggs because the warm inside the pan can cook the eggs. When your blend is fine you can put it on the fire again and mix for 4-5 minutes until it gets consistent.

Off fire keep mixing for 2 more minutes and pour the lemon curd into the pots. Let it get cool 1 hour or 2 and once it is cold enough put it in the fridge. You can keep your lemon curd for at least 1 week.
